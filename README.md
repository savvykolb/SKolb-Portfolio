# 08 Project 1: Professional Materials

## My Task

Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.

## The Acceptance Requirements I Met:

* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

They will see a grid (depending on screen size) of all my current and upcoming projects. When they click on an image, they will see the image dim and be given two choices to click. The 'plus' sign gives them more information on the project, the 'link' sign takes them to the live site.
