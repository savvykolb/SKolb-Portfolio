## My Portfolio Presentation

This application is my personaly job portfolio. This will be used for any job searches or freelance work. It will give any potential clients or future employers a glimpse into who I am and what my work is like. You will find there is an about me section, a list of all my skills, recent projects, my resume, and contact information.
